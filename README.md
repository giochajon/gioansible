Ansible playbooks to rebuild the servers at home and run routinary tasks on Debian based servers

This repository is to automate the creation of the 3 types of Ubuntu stations I have at home, below is a brief description
of the roles I cerated to accomplish the following:

Media server Computer:
a computer that allows me to drop a torrent link on a webpage, the computer will download the file using a vpn and then share
the file on the local network to be consumed by tablets and amazon firestick, media consoles or smartvs

this is accomplished by using DLNA server, Samba, transmission deamon and express vpn. 

Game retro gaming consoles
Computers to play retro arcade games using Retropie, they are to be automated as I want the same controller experience configured
(using xbox controllers) and the same roms, additionally network games from my GOG account to play Lan-party style.

Development environment
computers (usually VM's) that have the same terminal settings preinstalled git and vscode with the same plugins and the same
python environments and tools.
